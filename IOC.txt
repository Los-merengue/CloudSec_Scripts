• “Database traffic is up 200% from the monthly average. Maybe the application is
just really popular right now, but is someone systematically stealing our data?”

• “We just saw an outbound connection to an IP address that has been used by a
known threat actor recently, according to this threat intelligence feed. Is that a
compromised system talking to a command-and-control server?”

• “There were 150 failed login attempts on an account, followed by a success. Is
that a successful brute-force attack?”

• “We saw a single failed login attempt on 300 different accounts, followed by a
success on account #301. Is that a successful password spraying attack?”

• “A port scan was followed by a lot of traffic from a port that hasn’t been used in
months. Port scans happen all the time, but perhaps a vulnerable service was
found and compromised?”

• “John doesn’t normally log in at 3:00 AM ET, or from that country. Maybe that’s
not really John?”

• “Three different accounts logged in from the same system over the course of 30
minutes. It seems unlikely all of those people are actually using that system, so
maybe the system and those accounts are compromised?”

• “A new administrative account was just created outside of normal business hours.
Maybe someone’s working late, but maybe there’s an issue?”

• “Someone was just added to the administrator group. That’s a rare event, so
shouldn’t we check on it?”

• “Why are there firewall denies with an internal system as the source? Either
something is misconfigured or there’s an unauthorized user trying to move
around the network.”
